#summary Standards applicable to the entirety of the code base

= Syntax =

 * Use !CamelCase, i.e. lowerFollowedByUpperCase names for variables and methods. Class names BeginWithUpperCaseAndContinueUsingUpperCase.

 * Use hard tabs, not spaces. You may need to configure your editor to do this.

 * Use semi-objective-c notation for variables. A typical method of access for a variable {{{x}}} is:

{{{
int x;

public void setX(int i) {
   x=i;
}

public int getX() {
   return x;
}
}}}

 * Each class gets its own .java file.
