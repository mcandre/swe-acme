#summary Standards applicable to the entirety of the code base

= Syntax =

 * Code for Java 1.5 compatibility.

 * Use !CamelCase for just about everything, i.e. lowerFollowedByUpperCase names for variables and methods. Class names !BeginWithUpperCaseAndContinueUsingUpperCase. Constants use ALL_UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.

 * Use hard tabs, not spaces. You may need to configure your editor to do this.

 * One class per {{{.java}}} file.

 * Block notation and indentation are as follows:

{{{
begin a block {
   performOperations();
}
}}}

 * Most variables will be private. Use get and set methods for them. A typical method of access for a variable {{{x}}} is:

{{{
int x;

public void setX(int i) {
   x=i;
}

public int getX() {
   return x;
}
}}}

= Files =

 * Remove .class files before syncing to the Subversion repository.

 * Use Unix (LF) line endings and UTF8 encoding.
